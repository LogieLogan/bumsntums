## Conclusion
This DPIA identifies several key risks in processing personal and health-related data in the Bums 'n' Tums app. By implementing the proposed mitigation strategies, we can significantly reduce these risks while complying with GDPR requirements.

The app will implement technical measures like data separation, access controls, and encryption, alongside organizational measures like clear policies and user controls. These will be regularly reviewed and updated as the app evolves.
