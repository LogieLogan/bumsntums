# Food Scanning & Nutrition Tracking

## ML Kit Implementation

### Barcode Scanning
- **Implementation:** Firebase ML Kit's barcode scanning API
- **Functionality:**
  - Support for all common food barcode formats
  - Quick scan mode for multiple items
  - History of scanned products
  - Integration with Open Food Facts database (primary source for MVP)

### Food Database Strategy
- **Hybrid Approach:**
  - Local SQLite database with most common food items (10,000-20,000 products)
  - API fallback for products not found locally
  - Periodic background sync for frequently scanned items
  - Cache API responses for 24-48 hours

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- **Implementation:** Firebase ML Kit's text recognition API
- **Functionality:**
  - Nutrition label text extraction
  - Ingredient list scanning
  - Nutrition fact table recognition
  - Smart detection of serving sizes

## Processing Pipeline
1. **Image Preprocessing:**
   - Auto-focus and stabilization
   - Brightness/contrast adjustment
   - Perspective correction
   
2. **Text Extraction:**
   - Zonal OCR for targeted nutrition data
   - Pattern recognition for common label formats
   - Confidence scoring for extracted values
   
3. **Data Processing:**
   - Named entity recognition for ingredients
   - Unit conversion and standardization
   - Nutritional value extraction
   - Allergen and dietary concern flagging

4. **User-Specific Analysis:**
   - Comparison against dietary preferences (from fitness_profiles)
   - Goal-based recommendations
   - Historical food choices analysis
   
5. **Integration with OpenAI:**
   - Post-scan nutritional analysis
   - Food recommendations based on fitness goals
   - Natural language Q&A about scanned items
