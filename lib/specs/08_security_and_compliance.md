# Security & Compliance

## 8.1 Data Privacy Risk Assessment
- **Assessment Process:**
  - Conduct formal Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) before development
  - Review data flow diagrams to identify potential privacy issues
  - Evaluate third-party services for data protection compliance
  - Identify high-risk data processing activities

- **Key Risk Areas:**
  - Health and fitness data collection
  - User photo and video uploads
  - Location data (if applicable)
  - Integration with external services (Open Food Facts, OpenAI)

- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - Data minimization - collect only what's necessary
  - Purpose limitation - clearly define and enforce data usage boundaries
  - Storage limitation - establish retention periods for each data type:
    - User profile data: Retained until account deletion
    - Workout history: 12 months rolling window
    - Progress photos: User-controlled deletion
    - Scanned food data: 3 months for non-favorited items
    - Log data: 30 days for troubleshooting
  - Technical safeguards - secure storage, transmission, and access controls
  - User controls - transparent settings and export/deletion options

## 8.2 Data Protection
- **Firestore Security Rules:**
  - Strict isolation between PII and non-PII collections
  - Granular access controls
  - Field-level security for sensitive data
  - Request validation
  - Rate limiting
  
- **User Data Privacy:**
  - Separation of personal data from AI-accessible data
  - Standard Firebase encryption for sensitive user data
  - Implement data minimization practices
  - Provide data export functionality
  - Support data deletion requests (GDPR/CCPA compliance)
  
- **PII Protection for AI:**
  - AI features programmatically limited to non-PII collections only
  - No personal identifiers in AI conversations or logs
  - Anonymous user identification for AI features

## 8.2 Authentication Security
- Implement secure authentication flows
- Add multi-factor authentication option
- Create robust password policies
- Implement account recovery mechanisms

## 8.3 GDPR Compliance
- User data export mechanism
- "Right to be forgotten" implementation
- Clear privacy policy
- Consent management for data collection
- Data processing documentation
- Age verification mechanisms

## 8.4 Network Security
- HTTPS for all API communications
- Certificate pinning
- API key protection
- Request throttling
- Secure webhook implementations

## 8.5 Local Storage Security
- Encrypted local storage
- Secure credential storage
- Automatic session timeouts
- Secure biometric authentication integration
- Protection against screenshot/screen recording

## 8.6 Secure Coding Practices
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Parameterized queries
- Dependency security scanning
- Regular security code reviews
- Static code analysis

## 8.7 Vulnerability Management
- Regular security testing
- Penetration testing for major releases
- Responsible disclosure policy
- Security patch management
- Critical vulnerability response plan
