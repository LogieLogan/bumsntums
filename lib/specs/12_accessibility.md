# Accessibility Features

## Core Principles
- The app should be usable by everyone, regardless of ability
- Accessibility is considered from the start, not added as an afterthought
- All features should have accessible alternatives when needed

## Visual Accessibility

### High Contrast Mode
- Increased contrast between text and backgrounds
- Bold outlines for important UI elements
- Removal of decorative elements that may impair readability
- Custom theme with simplified color palette

### Text Customization
- Adjustable text size setting
- Support for system font size changes
- Bold text option for improved readability
- Font selection for dyslexia-friendly options

### Color Considerations
- Color blind-friendly palette
- Critical information never conveyed by color alone
- Alternative indicators (patterns, icons) alongside colors
- Color contrast testing for all UI elements

## Motion and Animation

### Reduced Motion Mode
- Option to minimize or disable non-essential animations
- Static alternatives to animated transitions
- Alternative to animation-heavy celebration moments
- Simplified progress indicators

## Workout Modifications

### Exercise Alternatives
- Each exercise includes modifications for different ability levels
- Seated alternatives for standing exercises
- Lower impact options for high-impact movements
- Equipment alternatives for accessibility

### Intensity Controls
- Adjustable workout pace beyond the standard timers
- Extended rest options
- Reduced rep/set options that still provide benefit
- "Pause anytime" feature prominently displayed

## Screen Reader Compatibility

### Content Descriptions
- All images have descriptive alt text
- Custom content descriptions for complex widgets
- Proper heading hierarchy for screen reader navigation
- Meaningful button labels (not just "click here")

### Navigation
- Logical focus order
- Skip navigation options
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Clear indication of current position in the app

## Physical Interaction

### Touch Target Sizes
- All interactive elements are at least 48x48dp
- Adequate spacing between touch targets
- Edge protection for important controls
- Forgiving touch areas around smaller visual elements

### Interaction Alternatives
- Voice command support for key features
- Simple gesture alternatives
- Support for external switch devices
- Keyboard navigation support
