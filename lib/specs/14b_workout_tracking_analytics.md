- Lack of visibility into progress toward goals
- Easy to skip workouts without consequence

### Progression & Adaptation
- Users don't know when to increase difficulty
- Plateaus in results due to repetitive workouts
- Inability to adjust plans when life gets in the way

### Discovery & Variety
- Boredom from doing the same routines
- Not knowing which workouts complement each other
- Difficulty finding workouts that match their level and equipment

### Time Management
- Fitting workouts into busy schedules
- Planning around recovery needs
- Balancing different workout types throughout the week

## The Enhanced Vision: AI-Driven Workout Planning Journey

The ideal workout planning experience should be intuitive, supportive, and adaptive - almost like having a personal trainer in your pocket, but more accessible and friendly. Users should never feel lost or confused about what to do next. The system should feel conversational, intelligent, and responsive to their needs. Since the calendar UI element is limited in fucntionality and design this should only be a supportive screen and another way to interact. The main planning funtionality should be a customized syetem built from the ground up.

NEW STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION BELOW
Simple list view of days of the week brpken up into weeks sections (date range at the top of each week section) scrollable, simple and clean. This is where all of the main planning, scheduling and core components should live.
Calendar screen is an additionl view displaying information simply and effectively.
Spatial consistency for intuitive navigation and interaction
Progressive disclosure of complexity based on user expertise
Micro-commitments to encourage consistent planning behavior
Living interfaces that subtly adapt to user patterns and needs
Fluid interaction patterns that feel natural and responsive

The implementation follows a phased approach, starting with refactoring planning screen UI. Next is core calendar functionality and progressively adding advanced features while maintaining simplicity and performance.
